    "This notebook allows a user to interact with a real RSA encrypter and decrypter.  The notebook contains many functions that build up the final functionality of the RSA encrypter/decrypter.  Any person with the base understand of RSA will have no problem using the notebook.  As you will see, the functionality of RSA has been broken down into 3 different parts for the user to surf through -- 1) Generating keys (you can select your p and q values or be pseudo-randomly assigned them), 2) Encrypting a message using a public key, and 3) Decrypting an encrypted cipher (must know the d value).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are still curious about RSA, I explore some aspects of the schema below the aforementioned implementer.  I include a section for decrypting messages with a d value, discuss the challenges of doing this, and answer some questions that I once had about the schema before actually learning it formally.  Have fun -- I sure did!"

In the main function, the user is prompted to either 1) Generate Keys, 2) Encode a Message, or 3) Decode a message. Users are advised to write down/copy the values they receive. After a user goes through the steps of one of the pathways (1, 2, or 3), they will be prompted if they wish to continue using the program. There is also extensive error-handling to ensure that the user is using the RSA schema correctly.\n",

All the user needs to do is run the block in the \"User Interface\" section (or run the main function straight up).  This also allows for a fast/convenient way for a user to use RSA.  It should be noted that this approach does not come without disadvantage, as scaling this program would take some effort on the backend (even with a command line macro/script).\n",

    "\n",
    "I have been exchanging keys and messages mostly with people who were able to finish coding the test, so there have only been a few people to correspond with (Thomas, Regean, Beth, and Brian namely).  At first, I was just generating my own keys and encrypting and decrypting my own messages/ciphers, which allowed me to build up my codebase.  Then, I took my classmates public and private keys from Piazza to decrypt some messages (this was a good proof of concept that everything was working, even outside the bubble that was my own codebase).  Next, I wanted to encrypt some messages for my classmates using public keys that they posted.  Me being me, I always like to have some fun with these types of exchanges so I encrypted and sent youtube video urls to them.  It was instant gratification to have them send me relevant youtube video urls back (using the public key that I posted on Piazza).\n",
    "\n",
    "When it came time to decrypt some of the public keys and ciphers that did not include the public keys; however, I quickly found that my brute force factoring algorithm was not nearly as efficient as I thought it was (I really thought that I had engineered that thing to handle the n's for this class).  In fact, I was really only able to crack very small n values, and was forced to stare at my screen for up a half hour before my program would just crash trying to factor larger values of n (these were Brian's public keys, as you'll see below in <a href='#code_cracking'>Chapter 10.3</a>.  I was so confused to see that other were able to crack his code -- Thomas told me that I should include a list of prime numbers from an external text file to save time with the prime list generation (at the time, I was using an implementation the Sieve of Eratosthenes -- which turned out to be wildly inefficient for large numbers).  After taking this advance, my brute force factorer fared slightly better, but I was still not able to crack Brian codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I was directed to Beth's post on using the Pollard's Rho algorithm for more efficient factoring.  Desperate to crack the code, I started reading into the theory behind the algorithm.  I actually only took some of the parts of the code originally, since I thought the \"pseduo-random' function could be any pseudorandom function, so I just used the random module to pick values of a and b (between 2 and n).  Finally!  After ~100,000,000 iterations, I had finally cracked Brian's code (this was the highlight of my excitement with the project -- it reminded me of mining cryptocurrencies; waiting, waiting, waiting, reward!  Very similar to gambling psychology, I suppose).  What was cool was that each time I wanted to crack the same code, it would take a different number of attempts: sometimes 100 million sometimes just 2 million.  It was fun to watch it work.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I realized that Brian had said that his Pollard's Rho was cracking everyone's codes in less than a second (which wasn't obviously the case for me).  In order to reach Brian's efficiency, I went back to Beth's code, and implemented the pseudorandom function f(x) = x^2 + 2 mod n.  Immediately I saw the results:  the codes that were taking (sometimes) over 100 million attempts were being calculated in 3000 attempts, everytime (no more variation).  Even Brian's very large n value (the last cipher in <a href='#code_cracking'>Chapter 10.3</a> was being cracked in less than 100,000 attempts.  It was very satisfying to see the progression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Honestly, the project was fairly straight-forward to me conceptually.  Although, I should note that I did not use any version control for this project, so whenever I needed to make a change that was suggested by my classmates, I was working without a real backup -- a little stressful at times.  Most of my challenges, though, came with the design of the final interface (making sure that all of the formatting was correct and that I could account for as many user errors as possible) and also the design of overall Jupyter file.  I wanted it to read through easily, be as modular as possible, and have a logical structure all around.  Regardless, I still want to thank Reagan, Thomas, Brian, and Beth for the ideas in improving the performance of my program."

    "It is very interesting to compare the types of n-factoring algorithms that I have implemented.  For example, my brute force factorer (n_breaker) does just fine with cracking smaller n values (less than a second runtime); however, when I tried to factor larger n values, it would just run and run and run (I let it try to factor Brian Solar's n for 25 minutes before terminating it) even though I have tried to optimize it by 1) using theorem two to eliminate many numbers to test and 2) loading in a list of prime numbers from a text file in the directory.  It just isn't feasible for these n's (which aren't even close to size that real RSA encryption use).  For my Pollard's Rho algorithm, however, the calculation is extremely fast -- less than a second for even large n's.  If I were going to try to implement my own RSA schema, I'd probably use this algorithm as a starting point to figure out how big the n values ought to be."

    "I ended up breaking several codes (listed above in <a href='#code_cracking'>chapter 10.3</a>).  I've included a cipher that I created using my program and also three ciphers that were posted by my classmates on Piazza.  Notice, that I used my naive brute force code cracker for the first two (which were much smaller n values), but I had to resort to the advanced factoring algorithm (Pollard's Rho implementation) for the final ciphers made by Brian (his n values were quite large, but the Pollard's Rho took care of them very quickly)."

    "\n",
    "Theorem 2 allows us to cut down the numbers tests that need to be performed tremendously.  The theorem states that any composite number must have a prime factor less than or equal to the square root of that number.  This means that instead of testing every number from 2 to n-1 (or every odd number greater than 2), we only need to test the prime numbers less than or equal to the square root of the number.  If a number is prime, then none of the primes from 2 to square root of that number will be a divisor.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the prime number 101.  It's square root is slightly larger than 10, so the largest number to consider is 10.  Now find all the prime numbers from 2 to 10, which are {2, 3, 5, 7}.  None of these numbers divide 101; therefore, 101 is a prime number.  So, we only had to test 4 numbers, whereas if we were using the brute force factoring scheme testing 2 to n-1, we would have had to have tested 99 numbers.  The runtime savings of using theorem 2 in a factoring algorithm just keep increasing as the number keeps growing."

    "\n",
    "My Previous Questions (just picking three):<br>\n",
    "<i>1. Why do the prime numbers chosen as the prime factors of n have to be of “roughly equal size”?</i><br>\n",
    "I think this makes it harder for someone to crack the n, because if you have one very large factor, then you are left with one smaller factor; therefore, it opens up the door find that smaller factor (or a multiple of it, if using an algorithm like Pollard's Rho).\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>2. When public/private keys are generated, what is doing the value selections?  A pseudo-random number generator?</i><br>\n",
    "A program most likely uses a pseudo-random prime selector (out of a pool of very large prime numbers), since it would be highly impractical to have the user find two extremely large prime numbers everytime they wanted to generate a public/private key pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>3. I’ve used PGP encryption before, and it seems to use a similar pattern of public-key exchange with a private key decryption.  Are these encryption methods related at all?</i><br>\n",
    "Well, we didn't cover PGP in this course; however, I now realize that PGP is not an algorithm that does the encryption/decryption, but actually the software that can use many different types of cryptographic algorithms (RSA included!) This definitely makes more sense now that I have actually worked through an implementation of an RSA scheme; next step -- rebuild PGP!\n",
    "\n",
    "I've learned a lot more than just the topics covered by these questions, but the biggest takeaway for me is the amount of computer power needed to work with big number theory concepts.  I don't think I really understood that finite computations could really take all that long to do -- for example, I thought after optimizing my brute force factorer that it would be able to crank through just about anything; however, it was miserably slow for those large prime numbers.  But that's the thing, the numbers that I was trying to crack weren't even all that large compared to the numbers used in real-RSA implementations!  It makes me realize why studying computer science is so important (compared to just learning how to program in a particular language).  Speed matters... A lot..."
